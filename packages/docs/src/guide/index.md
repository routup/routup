# What is it?

Routup is a minimalistic & extendable http interface based routing framework.
It uses node's vanilla request and response interfaces, which are injected into route- & middleware-handlers as function argument.
Helpers provide additional functionalities to transform and interact with the request and manipulate the response upstream.
